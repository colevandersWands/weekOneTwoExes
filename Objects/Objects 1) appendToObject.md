### Add to object

Write a function called modifyObject that takes 3 arguments, the first one is an object, the second one is a new key to be added to that object and the third and last argument is the value associated to the new key.
The function should not return anything. Example:


'''jsx
var obj = {a: 1, b: 2}
modifyObject(obj, "c", 3) // undefined in chrome console because of no return statement
obj // {a: 1, b: 2, c: 3}
'''
