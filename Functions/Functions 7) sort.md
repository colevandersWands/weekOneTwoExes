### Sort

Write a function called ```sort``` that sorts the values of an object, which should all be numbers, from the smallest to the biggest one. The function will return an object with keys going from 0 to n; where n is the number of properties of the object minus 1.
**Example:**

```jsx
obj = {a: 1, b: 20, c: 3, d: 4, e: 1, f: 4}
sort(obj) // {0: 1, 1: 1, 2: 3, 3: 4, 4: 20}
```

**Notes:** Do not use javascript's built in methods, instead try developing your own algorithim.
